==========
Welcome to prepair.us! As you're first challenge, we'll keep it simple, write a program which take a string as an input and outputs "Hello [input string]!". If the first letter of the input string is not a capital letter, write "Hello World!" instead. <b r/>
For example:
example.in contains
Person

Ouput should be:
Hello Person!

Might want to do a write up about prepair.us here

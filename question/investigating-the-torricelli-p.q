Moreover he proved that T, called the Torricelli/Fermat point, minimises p + q + r. Even more remarkable, it can be shown that when the sum is minimised, AN = BM = CO = p + q + r and that AN, BM and CO also intersect at T.</p><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"560\" src=\"project/images/p_143_torricelli.gif\" width=\"564\"/></div><p>If the sum is minimised and a, b, c, p, q and r are all positive integers we shall call triangle ABC a Torricelli triangle.
